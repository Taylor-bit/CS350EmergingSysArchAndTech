# CS350EmergingSysArchAndTech
## A repository for my work completed throughout my CS-350 Emerging Systems Architectures and Technologies course at Southern New Hampshire University

This project entailed creating a prototype smart thermostat that uses an AHT20 sensor to detect temperature via I2C, uses GPIO and PWM LEDs to regulate heating and cooling indicators, receives button input via interrupts, displays data on a 16x2 LCD, and transmits status updates via UART. To guarantee consistent behavior and smooth transitions, the system was built around a clear state machine (Off, Heat, Cool), as seen in the diagram provided in this repository. It addressed the challenge of creating a working Internet of Things(IoT) thermostat while determining which hardware architecture would best satisfy long-term business needs for affordability, scalability, and efficiency.

Prior to suggesting a production-ready solution, I did a particularly good job of thoroughly investigating the Raspberry Pi, Microchip, and NXP Cortex-M architectures and structuring the system around a state-driven design. Enhancing the architecture for low-power embedded deployment and incorporating more effective error handling are two ways I could improve. Using vendor SDK resources, IoT research, and microcontroller documentation, I am expanding my support network moving forward. State machine modeling, peripheral integration (I2C, UART, GPIO, PWM), and architectural assessment are all highly transferable skills from this project to future embedded and systems coursework. By keeping state logic and hardware control separate, utilizing straightforward naming and documentation, and coordinating the implementation with a formal state diagram to facilitate future growth, I made the project manageable and flexible.
